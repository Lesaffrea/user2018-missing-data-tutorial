# Motivation

### Why would I want to deal with missing data?

???

I was handed a dataset in my PhD that had more than 65% of the data missing. 
We had to spend quite a bit of time exploring the missingness relationships and
the whole process was very frustrating, this inspired me to develop methods for
exploring missing data, which ended up being a substantial part of my thesis

But today we are going to talk about some example weather data from Melbourne.

# Example

### San Francisco weather data 
### || Date | Wind | Temp ||
### Using the R package: [`GSODR`](https://github.com/ropensci/gsodr)
### [(Global Surface Summary of the Day)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)

### Written by Adam Sparks

# Why data was missing

So here we can create a graphic where we can see the data that are present are in blue, and the data that are missing are in red. What we see here then is that the data that are missing for air temperature are in red here, but are actually measured only beyond gust speeds of 8 kpmh

So in cases of strong winds, the air temperature measurements break. Done. Dusted.

Wait, What?

But, like all good explanations, this one is simple - but the process to get there, where we describe it, probably was not.

In order to get to a position where you could generate this graphic, and show this data, you probably had to spend more time than you would have liked developing exploratory data analyses and models

It might seem obvious to point out the precise mechanism for generating the missingness, but this is kind of difficult when there is a lot of missing data, or when there are many variables.

# Questions

.vhugew[
1. How to start looking at missing data

2. How to start exploring why data is missing

# Design Principles

.vhugew[

Easy to use

Quick to remember

Complement existing tools

]
???

There's also these two other principles:

1. Convenience - easy to remember and use
2. Design / Philosophy - easy to use and interact with other tools

To look at these questions I am going to discuss some tools that  I have built with Di Cook and Miles McBain, to facilitate the highlighting and exploration of missing values.

I'll then move discuss the way that we can handle and manipulate missing data.

I will then move to discuss the problems with current methods for exploring and visualising missings, and what we can do about it.
